		An elegant set of language bindings to allow you to write
		native GNOME applications in Java. Works with both traditional
		Java VMs and also with GCJ, allowing the creation of native
		Linux executable binaries.

		This library comes from the java-gnome project, which in turn
		is part of the official suite of GNOME language bindings.

		This ebuild contains the Java bindings around the LibGlade
		library. LibGlade allows a program to read in an interface
		description file, created by Glade, and generate its graphical
		user interface based on that file - at runtime!

		[Hint: this coupled with the Eclipse IDE makes for awesome
		Rapid Application Development on the GTK/GNOME platform]

		If you're interested in this you probably want to emerge
		java-gnome - a meta package which in turn depends on the
		various GNOME libraries which comprise the complete java-gnome
		language binding suite. More probably, some program that uses
		java-gnome libraries will be bringing it in for you.
