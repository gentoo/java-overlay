  30 Jul 2015;  <andreas@gentoo.org> ebean-2.7.7.ebuild, metadata.xml:
  [dev-java/ebean] Fix metadata, scala slot

  7 Aug 2012; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  ebean-2.7.7.ebuild, +files/jdk7.patch:
  Fix building with JDK7. Conditional patching is bad but this is just
  to satisfy the abstract JDBC classes when building. It should still
  run the same.

*ebean-2.7.7 (5 Aug 2012)

  5 Aug 2012; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -ebean-2.7.3.ebuild, +ebean-2.7.7.ebuild:
  Version bump. apicheck reports breakages but almost entirely on
  internal classes, upstream cites these as "bug fixes", and this is
  only used for Minecraft anyway so sticking to slot 0. Upstream no
  longer builds against 1.5 so GNU Classpath hack can be dropped.

*ebean-2.7.3 (15 Dec 2011)

  15 Sep 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +ebean-2.7.3.ebuild, +files/no-scala.patch:
  Initial import. Tricky to build as JDBC stuff requires GNU Classpath but this
  doesn't support Pattern.quote.
