## NOTES

# This configuration file is based on the options enumerated in the
# JBoss source code at:
#
# jboss-x.y.z-src/system/src/main/org/jboss/system/server/ServerConfig
#
# You may chose to add additional settings from there to this file.
# We present a basic subset by default.

## GENERAL SETTINGS

# You can choose which configuration you want to run JBoss with.  The
# default configuration is, you guessed it, 'default'. The Gentoo
# JBoss installation ships with two other predefined configurations;
# 'all' and 'minimal'. The configurations are located in
# $JBOSS_HOME/server/

# JBOSS_CONF="all"
JBOSS_CONF="default"
# JBOSS_CONF="minimal"

# Console logging defaults to '/dev/null'. This env variable is
# included for debugging purposes.  You might have to run add
# $JBOSS_USER to the 'console' group to gain access to '/dev/console'.

JBOSS_CONSOLE="/dev/null" 
# JBOSS_CONSOLE="/dev/console"

# The user JBoss will run as.

JBOSS_USER="jboss"


## SPECIFIC SETTINGS

SERVER_SETTINGS=""

# The directory JBoss will use for temporary file storage

SERVER_SETTINGS="${SERVER_SETTINGS} -Djboss.server.temp.dir=/var/tmp/jboss-4"

# The directory which JBoss will use for persistent data file storage

SERVER_SETTINGS="${SERVER_SETTINGS} -Djboss.server.data.dir=/var/cache/jboss-4"

# The base URL for calculating server home URLs.  In a stock JBoss
# install, this would be <jboss_home>/server/ where sub-directories
# default, minimal and all exist.  Our defaults are /var/lib/jboss to
# be consistent with other servers such as PostgreSQL and Apache.

SERVER_HOME="/var/lib/jboss-4/"
SERVER_SETTINGS="${SERVER_SETTINGS} -Djboss.server.base.url=file://${SERVER_HOME}"

# Whether or not the server should exit the JVM on shutdown

SERVER_SETTINGS="${SERVER_SETTINGS} -Djboss.server.exitonshutdown=true"

# Whether or not the server should shutdown synchronously (true) or
# asynchronously (false).

SERVER_SETTINGS="${SERVER_SETTINGS} -Djboss.server.blockingshutdown=true"

# The address JBoss will bind services to.  (Note: JBoss 3.2.3 ignores
# the JVM environment parameter in favour of the command line switch.)

JBOSS_BIND_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0"

## STARTUP/SHUTDOWN CONFIGURATION

# Commands used in starting/stopping the server.  Normally you would
# not need to change the following settings.

# We need to have JBOSS_HOME and JAVA_HOME set in order to start
# jboss.

JBOSS_HOME="/usr/share/jboss-4"
[ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ] && export JAVA_HOME=`java-config --jdk-home`

# Commands for starting and stopping the server

CMD_START="JAVA_OPTS=\"${SERVER_SETTINGS}\" ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/run.sh -b ${JBOSS_BIND_ADDRESS} -c ${JBOSS_CONF}" 

CMD_STOP="${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -classpath ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/shutdown.jar:${JBOSS_HOME}/lib/jboss-system.jar:`java-config --classpath=jboss` org.jboss.Shutdown -S"

SUBIT="su $JBOSS_USER -c "
