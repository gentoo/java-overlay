[unscramble] CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
[unscramble] REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
[unscramble] TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN
[unscramble] ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will
[unscramble] Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
[unscramble] negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for

[unscramble] governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No
[unscramble] choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

[unscramble] 10. Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to
[unscramble] be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the
[unscramble] provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of
[unscramble] the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately
[unscramble] terminate.

[unscramble]       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
[unscramble]       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
[unscramble]       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
[unscramble]       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
[unscramble]       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
[unscramble]       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
[unscramble]       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

[unscramble]       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

[unscramble]       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

[unscramble]       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
[unscramble]       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
[unscramble]       subsequently incorporated within the Work.

[unscramble]    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
[unscramble]       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
[unscramble]       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
[unscramble]       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
[unscramble]       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

[unscramble]       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
[unscramble]       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
[unscramble]       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
[unscramble]       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
[unscramble]       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
[unscramble]       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

[unscramble]       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
[unscramble]       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
[unscramble]       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
[unscramble]       as of the date such litigation is filed.

[unscramble]    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
[unscramble]       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
[unscramble]       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
[unscramble]       meet the following conditions:

[unscramble]       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
[unscramble]           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

[unscramble]       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
[unscramble]           stating that You changed the files; and

[unscramble]       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
[unscramble]           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
[unscramble]           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
[unscramble]           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
[unscramble]           the Derivative Works; and

[unscramble]       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
[unscramble]           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
[unscramble]           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
[unscramble]           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
[unscramble]           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
[unscramble]           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
[unscramble]           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
[unscramble]           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
[unscramble]           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
[unscramble]           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
[unscramble]           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
[unscramble]           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
[unscramble]           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
[unscramble]           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
[unscramble]           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
[unscramble]           as modifying the License.

[unscramble]       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
[unscramble]       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
[unscramble]       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
[unscramble]       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
[unscramble]       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
[unscramble]       the conditions stated in this License.

[unscramble]    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
[unscramble]       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
[unscramble]       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
[unscramble]       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
[unscramble]       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
[unscramble]       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
[unscramble]       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

[unscramble]    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
[unscramble]       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
[unscramble]       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
[unscramble]       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

[unscramble]    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
[unscramble]       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
[unscramble]       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
[unscramble]       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
[unscramble]       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
[unscramble]       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
[unscramble]       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
[unscramble]       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
[unscramble]       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

[unscramble]    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
[unscramble]       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
[unscramble]       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
[unscramble]       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
[unscramble]       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
[unscramble]       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
[unscramble]       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
[unscramble]       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
[unscramble]       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
[unscramble]       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
[unscramble]       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

[unscramble]    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
[unscramble]       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
[unscramble]       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
[unscramble]       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
[unscramble]       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
[unscramble]       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
[unscramble]       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
[unscramble]       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
[unscramble]       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
[unscramble]       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[unscramble] -------------------------------------- [/var/tmp/portage/netbeans-4.0/work/netbeans-src/junit/external/ibm-public-license.txt]
[unscramble] Common Public License - v 1.0

[unscramble] THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
[unscramble] LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
[unscramble] CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

[unscramble] 1. DEFINITIONS

[unscramble] "Contribution" means:

[unscramble]       a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
[unscramble] documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
[unscramble] b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

[unscramble] i) changes to the Program, and

[unscramble] ii) additions to the Program;

[unscramble] where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
[unscramble] distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
[unscramble] Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
[unscramble] acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
[unscramble] the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
[unscramble] conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
[unscramble] derivative works of the Program.

[unscramble] "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

[unscramble] "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
[unscramble] necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
[unscramble] combined with the Program.

[unscramble] "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

[unscramble] "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
[unscramble] including all Contributors.

[unscramble] 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

[unscramble] a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
[unscramble] Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
[unscramble] reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
[unscramble] distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
[unscramble] derivative works, in source code and object code form.

[unscramble] b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
[unscramble] Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
[unscramble] Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
[unscramble] Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
[unscramble] This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
[unscramble] Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
[unscramble] addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
[unscramble] Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
[unscramble] which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

[unscramble] c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
[unscramble] its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
[unscramble] Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
[unscramble] property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
[unscramble] Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
[unscramble] intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
[unscramble] rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
[unscramble] responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
[unscramble] For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
[unscramble] distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
[unscramble] before distributing the Program.

[unscramble] d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
[unscramble] rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
[unscramble] this Agreement.

[unscramble] 3. REQUIREMENTS

[unscramble] A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
[unscramble] own license agreement, provided that:

[unscramble] a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

[unscramble] b) its license agreement:

[unscramble] i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
[unscramble] conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
[unscramble] non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
[unscramble] fitness for a particular purpose;

[unscramble] ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
[unscramble] damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
[unscramble] damages, such as lost profits;

[unscramble] iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
[unscramble] that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

[unscramble] iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
[unscramble] and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
[unscramble] medium customarily used for software exchange.

[unscramble] When the Program is made available in source code form:

[unscramble] a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

[unscramble] b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

[unscramble] Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
[unscramble] Program.

[unscramble] Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
[unscramble] any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
[unscramble] originator of the Contribution.


[unscramble] 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

[unscramble] Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
[unscramble] respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
[unscramble] intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
[unscramble] includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
[unscramble] which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
[unscramble] a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
[unscramble] Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
[unscramble] every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
[unscramble] and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
[unscramble] actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
[unscramble] extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
[unscramble] connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
[unscramble] offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
[unscramble] relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
[unscramble] to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
[unscramble] Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
[unscramble] control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
[unscramble] related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
[unscramble] any such claim at its own expense.

[unscramble] For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
[unscramble] offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
[unscramble] Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
[unscramble] related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
[unscramble] Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
[unscramble] Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
[unscramble] Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
[unscramble] requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
[unscramble] Contributor must pay those damages.

[unscramble] 5. NO WARRANTY

[unscramble] EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
[unscramble] "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
[unscramble] IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
[unscramble] NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
[unscramble] Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
[unscramble] distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
[unscramble] rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
[unscramble] program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
[unscramble] programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

[unscramble] 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY


[unscramble] EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
[unscramble] CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
[unscramble] SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
[unscramble] PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
[unscramble] STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
[unscramble] OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
[unscramble] GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

[unscramble] 7. GENERAL

[unscramble] If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
[unscramble] law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
[unscramble] terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
[unscramble] provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
[unscramble] provision valid and enforceable.

[unscramble] If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
[unscramble] a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
[unscramble] lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
[unscramble] under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
[unscramble] addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
[unscramble] (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
[unscramble] itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
[unscramble] infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
[unscramble] Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

[unscramble] All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
[unscramble] comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
[unscramble] not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
[unscramble] such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
[unscramble] Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
[unscramble] reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
[unscramble] and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
[unscramble] survive.

[unscramble] Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
[unscramble] order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
[unscramble] modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
[unscramble] publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
[unscramble] No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
[unscramble] IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
[unscramble] as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
[unscramble] Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
[unscramble] Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
[unscramble] under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
[unscramble] is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
[unscramble] Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
[unscramble] 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
[unscramble] intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
[unscramble] expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
[unscramble] expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

[unscramble] This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
[unscramble] intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
[unscramble] Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
[unscramble] after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
[unscramble] any resulting litigation.

[unscramble] license to reproduce internally and use internally the Software, complete and unmodified, 
[unscramble] for the sole purpose of designing, developing, testing and running your Java applets 
[unscramble] and applications. For clarification, the Software will be considered unmodified if you have 
[unscramble] compiled the Software using a compliant Java compiler.

[unscramble] 2. License to Distribute Software.  In addition to the license granted in Section 1 
[unscramble] (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant) of these Supplemental Terms, 
[unscramble] subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited 
[unscramble] to Section 3 (Java Technology Restrictions), Sun grants you a non-exclusive, 
[unscramble] non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and distribute the Software provided 
[unscramble] that you (i) distribute the Software complete and unmodified and only bundled as part 
[unscramble] of your Programs, (ii) do not distribute additional software intended to replace any 
[unscramble] component(s) of the Software, (iii) do not remove or alter any proprietary legends 
[unscramble] or notices contained in the Software, (iv) only distribute the Software subject to a license 
[unscramble] agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained 
[unscramble] in this Agreement, and (v) agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from 
[unscramble] and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including 
[unscramble] attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third 
[unscramble] party that arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all Programs and/or 
[unscramble] Software. 

[unscramble] 3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform Interface 
[unscramble] ("JPI", identified as classes contained within the "java" package or any subpackages of 
[unscramble] the "java" package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing 
[unscramble] the addition to or modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that you create 
[unscramble] an additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the functionality of the Java 
[unscramble] Platform, and (ii) is exposed to third party software developers for the purpose 
[unscramble] of developing additional software which invokes such additional API, you must promptly 
[unscramble] publish broadly an accurate specification for such API for free use by all developers. 
[unscramble] You may not create, or authorize your licensees to create additional classes, interfaces, 
[unscramble] or subpackages that are in any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar 
[unscramble] convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation. 

[unscramble] 4. Trademarks and Logos. You acknowledge and agree as between you and Sun that Sun owns 
[unscramble] the SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET trademarks and all SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, 
[unscramble] JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET-related trademarks, service marks, logos and other brand 
[unscramble] designations ("Sun Marks"), and you agree to comply with the Sun Trademark and Logo Usage 
[unscramble] Requirements currently located at http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any use you 
[unscramble] make of the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit. 

[unscramble] 5. Termination for Infringement. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately 
[unscramble] should any Software become, or in either party's opinion be likely to become, the subject 
[unscramble] of a claim of infringement of any intellectual property right.

[unscramble] 2. RESTRICTIONS. Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to
[unscramble]    Software and all associated intellectual property rights is
[unscramble]    retained by Sun and/or its licensors. Except as specifically
[unscramble]    authorized in any Supplemental License Terms, you may not make
[unscramble]    copies of Software, other than a single copy of Software for
[unscramble]    archival purposes. Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable
[unscramble]    law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer Software.
[unscramble]    You acknowledge that Software is not designed, licensed or intended

[unscramble]    PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO
[unscramble]    THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

[unscramble] 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
[unscramble]    EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
[unscramble]    PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL
[unscramble]    OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF

[unscramble]    SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in
[unscramble]    contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the
[unscramble]    amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
[unscramble]    limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of
[unscramble]    its essential purpose.

[unscramble] 6. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may
[unscramble]    terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of
[unscramble]    Software. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
[unscramble]    from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of this

[unscramble]    governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No
[unscramble]    choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

[unscramble]     provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of
[unscramble]     the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately

[unscramble]     or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other
[unscramble]     communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
[unscramble]     during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this
[unscramble]     Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an
[unscramble]     authorized representative of each party.

[unscramble] JAVASERVLET, VERSION 2.3
[unscramble] SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS

[unscramble] These supplemental license terms ("Supplemental Terms") add to or
[unscramble] modify the terms of the Binary Code License Agreement (collectively,
[unscramble] the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms not defined in these Supplemental
[unscramble] Terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
[unscramble] These Supplemental Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or
[unscramble] conflicting terms in the Agreement, or in any license contained within
[unscramble] the Software.

[unscramble] 1. Software Internal Use and Development License Grant. Subject to the
[unscramble]    terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited
[unscramble]    to Section 3 (Java(TM) Technology Restrictions) of these
[unscramble]    Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive,
[unscramble]    non-transferable, limited license to reproduce internally and use
[unscramble]    internally the binary form of the Software, complete and
[unscramble]    unmodified, for the sole purpose of designing, developing and
[unscramble]    testing your Java applets and applications ("Programs").

[unscramble] 2. License to Distribute Software. In addition to the license granted
[unscramble]    in Section 1 (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant)
[unscramble]    of these Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and conditions of
[unscramble]    this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 3 (Java
[unscramble]    Technology Restrictions), Sun grants you a non-exclusive,
[unscramble]    non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and distribute the
[unscramble]    Software in binary form only, provided that you (i) distribute the
[unscramble]    Software complete and unmodified and only bundled as part of your
[unscramble]    Programs, (ii) do not distribute additional software intended to
[unscramble]    replace any component(s) of the Software, (iii) do not remove or
[unscramble]    alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in the Software,
[unscramble]    (iv) only distribute the Software subject to a license agreement
[unscramble]    that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained
[unscramble]    in this Agreement, and (v) agree to defend and indemnify Sun and
[unscramble]    its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities,
[unscramble]    settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees)
[unscramble]    incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any
[unscramble]    third party that arises or results from the use or distribution of
[unscramble]    any and all Programs and/or Software.

[unscramble] 3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform
[unscramble]    Interface ("JPI", identified as classes contained within the "java"
[unscramble]    package or any subpackages of the "java" package), by creating
[unscramble]    additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition
[unscramble]    to or modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that you
[unscramble]    create an additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends
[unscramble]    the functionality of the Java Platform, and (ii) is exposed to
[unscramble]    third party software developers for the purpose of developing
[unscramble]    additional software which invokes such additional API, you must
[unscramble]    promptly publish broadly an accurate specification for such API for
[unscramble]    free use by all developers. You may not create, or authorize your
[unscramble]    licensees to create additional classes, interfaces, or subpackages
[unscramble]    that are in any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar
[unscramble]    convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention
[unscramble]    designation.

[unscramble] 4. Trademarks and Logos. You acknowledge and agree as between you and
[unscramble]    Sun that Sun owns the SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET
[unscramble]    trademarks and all SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and
[unscramble]    iPLANET-related trademarks, service marks, logos and other brand
[unscramble]    designations ("Sun Marks"), and you agree to comply with the Sun
[unscramble]    Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements currently located at
[unscramble]    http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any use you make of the Sun
[unscramble]    Marks inures to Sun's benefit.

[unscramble] 5. Source Code. Software may contain source code that is provided
[unscramble]    solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this
[unscramble]    Agreement. Source code may not be redistributed unless expressly
[unscramble]    provided for in this Agreement.

[unscramble] 6. Termination for Infringement. Either party may terminate this
[unscramble]     Agreement immediately should any Software become, or in either
[unscramble]     party's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of
[unscramble]     infringement of any intellectual property right.
